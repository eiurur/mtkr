Chrome Extension to help manage your Amazon prime video watching.

## Motivation

I mainly watch movies on Amazon prime video. I used to manage un-watched and watched together in the default watch list, but it's getting cumbersome.  
The movie which has been watched should be managed by the existing external service, but it is too much trouble and is unbearable. Of course, this will be suitable for users who use multiple video sites. (prime video/Netflix/U-NEXT/etc.)  
However, as I only watch movies on Prime Video, it's important to me that there are no screen transitions required and that I can register with one click.
